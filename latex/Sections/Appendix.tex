\caption[Colour Indexes]{Colour Indexes for RGB (8-bit), HSV, CMYK, and YUV.}\label{table:app:colours}
\end{table}


A colour space is a way to index colours under a certain schema. There are 4 main types used in digital processing:

\begin{enumerate}

\enumdesc{RGB}{ Red-Green-Blue; directly maps to the Red/Green/Blue channels on monitors where (for example) an increase in the R-component will produce a redder image, and likewise with the G and B components for greener and bluer images respectively. Intermediate colours such as Yellow, Purple, and Brown are created 1:1 representations of two channels (with the third remaining constant), and Black$\rightarrow$Grey$\rightarrow$White representations are produced when locking the values of all three channels. Darkening and lightening an image requires changing all three channels.}
\enumdesc{CMYK}{ Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Key; where Key represents the darkness of an image. The colour model is used primarily in printers and uses subtractive mixing to achieve different colour blends (e.g. Green is the subtraction of Yellow and Cyan). Has the same colour scaling patterns as RGB but can produce darker semitones using the K component.}
\enumdesc{YUV}{ Luminance-ChromaU-ChromaV; where Luminance denotes the brightness and the two chroma channels denote separate colour ranges as shown by the two axes in Figure~\ref{fig:app:yuv}. The colour model makes use of the human eye's lack of color perception compared to awareness of changes in brightness. Early engineers used this 'hack' to reduce the size of TV transmissions by reducing the U and V components of an image without any perceptible difference to the quality of the image.

{fig:app:yuv}
{0.3}

}

\enumdesc{HSV}{ Hue-Saturation-Value; where Hue denotes a shade of colour, Saturation the intensity of the colour, and Value being the brightness. This allows for changes in colour to be recorded by a single channel only and is a very convenient way to modify brightness too. Stepping through a rainbow of colours involves only modifying the H component, as shown in Figure\pref{fig:disc:huescale}.}

\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{table:app:colours} shows the values that each colour model takes for each colour in the table. Note the constancy in the S and V channels of the HSV model.



\subsection{Primitives}\label{ref:app:primitives}

Data generally comes in two forms:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{{\bf Numeric}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{decimal}, the integer value of a number represented in base-2 (or 'binary') number format, (e.g. 8 = 1000 (4-bits), 7 = 111 (3-bits), 652 = 101000110 (9-bits)). For n bits, the decimal range is [0,$2^n - 1$]\footnote{This is only in case of positive unsigned integers. To include negative integers too, the first bit is sacrificed as an indicator of polarity. This produces signed integers and follows a more involved schema known as \textit{two's-complement} in order to only have a single representation of the number zero. The numeric range for n bits is then [-2n-1, 2n-1 - 1].}.Decimals tend to come in fixed bit-sizes\footnote{byte (8-bit), short/char (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit), and (in some languages) long long (128-bit).} so there can be some redundancy in representing a small number with a large decimal type.}
	\item{\textbf{floating-point} numbers are a compact approximation of a number as deemed by the specification\citep{floats}. Numbers are represented as powers of exponents such that $5 \sim= e^{1.61}$ (where 1.61 would be the stored number in this loose example). The precision of the representation is determined by how many bits the number has. Floats have a much larger range than decimals, albeit with less accuracy}
	\end{enumerate}
}
\item{{\bf Textual}\\See Strings section below.}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Strings}\label{ref:app:strings}
Strings are a type of data that is defined as any block of text surrounded by single or double quotation marks. Strings compared to other data types are very memory intensive since it is usually unclear exactly how much memory a string is going to take.

Numbers can be assigned specific memory sizes to contain their values such as char(8-bit) , short(16-bit), int(32-bit), and long(64-bit) for decimal numbers, and float(32-bit) and double(64-bit) for floating point numbers, each with their specific range of values.

Strings are essentially an array of characters, and so if each character is 8-bit, then the phrase "Hello World!" has a size of 96 bits (12 characters x 8 bits) . When strings are created they are assigned initial sizes to contain a specific text, but they are essentially immutable past this point since concatenating two strings together requires re-computing their sizes and copying the text into a new block of memory (i.e. you cannot directly shorten or extend a string since it creates memory leaks).

\subsubsection{String Interning}

Because of the costly processes of manipulating strings during program runtime, some string-processing tasks take place to reduce the redundancy in duplicate strings. A list of all unique strings declared in the code are "pooled" into static addresses at compile-time, and then are referenced every time a string variable is assigned one of their values. 

When an entirely new string is required, the "new" keyword is used to tell the environment that it will not be referencing a previously pooled-string and that extra memory must be allocated.


\subsection{RegEx}\label{ref:app:regex}

Regular Expressions (also known as RegEx or RegExp) are character patterns that are used to match text or `strings' in a flexible manner. A relevant example would be trying to match a [chromosome,position] tuple:

\begin{lstlisting}
chr01  87654321  [DETAILS] // <--file1
    1:87654321   [DETAILS] // <--file2
  01  87654321   [DETAILS] // <--file3
\end{lstlisting}

Here, all files reference the same variant (chromosome 1, position 87654321) but due to the flexibility of the VCF specification and the non-standardization of recording conventions between biologists, there is much disparity between the way they are referenced. However a good regex to match the same variant in all these files would be simply:

\begin{lstlisting}
^(chr){0,1}(0){0,1}1(:|\s+)(87654321)
\end{lstlisting}
which, in pseudo-code translates to "at the beginning of the line, look for 0 to 1 mentions of 'chr' followed by 0 to 1 mentions of '0', followed by a '1', followed by either a ':' character OR('$\vert$')  1 or more ('+') mentions of a white-space ('\\s') character (e.g. a tab, a space), followed by '87654321'.


\subsubsection{Regex String Component}

Parsing strings for specific phrases is another feat as it requires tokenizing the data into characters and performing character matching upon a reference string. This is not hard if you have a specific string in mind to compare (e.g matching "Hello" in "Hello World" would complete its search after comparing only the first 5 characters), but becomes much more complex when dealing with more abstract search criteria (e.g. extracting all lines in a text file that contain full stops but NOT commas).

This is where regex takes precedence as it converts a reference string into what is known as a Finite State Automaton (FSA) which links together characters in such a way that one character can lead to the next but only in a specific pattern. For example to match any sequence that has an 'X' followed  by 0 or more 'Y's followed by an 'X' again is specified by pattern:  XY*X

Figure~\ref{fig:fsa} shows how such a pattern is first converted into character-specific states of 'X', 'Y' and blank intermediaries which allow a specific sequence of letters occur by taking either one of paths 'a' or 'b'. This state diagram can be further compacted and optimized into a Deterministic Finite State Automaton (DFSA) which is a simple non-character specific two-state system which allows transitions between states via 'X' and 'Y' input paths. The table below shows possible string matching scenarios using such a system and it shoud be noted that the last string input is not valid for the RegEx given hence why it ends prematurely.

\fignownocap{./Sections/images/FSA.png}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|l|}
  \hline
  \multicolumn{2}{ | c | }{RegExp :XY*X} \\
   \hline
  String & Path Taken \\
  \hline
  XX & a(b)a \\
  XYX & a(aa)a \\
  XYYYX & a(aa)b(aa) \\
  XYXYX & a(a?END) \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

DFSA's can be further compacted and optimized to create fast pattern matching systems with little overhead, making them the ideal tool to deal with strings flexibly. Multiple genetic sequences can be extracted this way by using the same regular expression undoubtedly making RegEx a very powerful tool for programmers and geneticists alike.

\subsection{Licensing}\label{ref:app:licensing}

Software licences are typically split into two groups: \textit{CopyLeft} and \textit{Permissive}.

\begin{description}
\item[CopyLeft]{
A CopyLeft license is a protective license that allows anyone to modify and/or redistribute copies of their work under the condition that they must distribute their source code and that the receiver must also be bound under the same agreement. This ensures that software remains \gls{comp:FOSS} throughout all works that incorporate the license.

Free Software Movement guru Richard Stallman was the first to create a Copyleft license, the \gls{comp:GNU} \citep{stallman1998gnu} General Public License (GPL), which has gone on to make two more versions:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{GPLv2}
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item{\textbf{GPLv2.1}, Enforces the copyleft obligation of the license in all works that incorporate it.}
		\item{\textbf{Lesser GPL (LGPL)}, Weakens the obligation so that it can be incorporated into proprietary software, where the LGPL portions of the code must still be FOSS to the end-user. Has the extra caveat that LGPL can be relicensed under any GPL.}
		\end{enumerate}
	}
	\item{\textbf{GPLv3}, Better relicensing, protection from DRM (in theory), and no source code redistribution requirement as long as no software if redistributed either \citep{gplv3}.}
	\item{\textbf{Affero GPL (AGPL)}, Same as GPLv2 except it fixes a loophole caused by Application Service Providers (ASPs) who allowed users to use software, but did not distribute it themselves and thus were protected from copyleft jurisdiction. The fix involves making the source code available to any network user on an AGPL network. In the case of the a scripting web language like Javascript, this is now default behaviour \citep{agplv3}.}
	\end{enumerate}
	}
\item[Permissive]{
A license that lets anyone do whatever they want without any restrictions on modification and redistribution, but they must credit the original author who is not held liable for any problems that occur later on.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{BSD}, Based upon the original licensing of FreeBSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) Operating System. Distributors are not allowed to use the original author's name in an unwanted way \citep{bsd}.}
	\item{\textbf{MIT}, Same as BSD but without endorsement restrictions, freer \citep{mit}.}
	\item{\textbf{Apache}, Same as MIT, but any modifications made must be announced and the project name/trademark must differ from original unless name use is desired from original author.}
	\end{enumerate}
}
\end{description}


\subsection{Compiler}\label{ref:app:compiler}

There are several optimizations that the compiler undertakes to optimize user-written code to be more efficiently read and processed by the \gls{comp:CPU}.

The optimizations are too numerous to list, but a few examples are provided below in order to provide some reference upon the nature of the optimizations:

\begin{description}
\descitem{Parallelize}{Split sequential data into separate dependency chains that can be processed in parallel.}
\descitem{Common Expression Elimination}{Calculate the value of reused static expressions only once, and cache the result.}
\descitem{Expand Constants}{Precompute expressions that involve only constants so that they don't need to be calculated at runtime.}
\descitem{Strength Reduction}{Convert difficult operations into smaller easier ones. e.g. replace an integer multiplication with a series of repeated additions instead.}
\descitem{Fast Pathing}{Split an instruction set into a "fast" path that handles the majority of input cases, and handle the infrequent edge cases separately.}
\descitem{Tail Recursion Elimination}{Convert stack-greedy recursive functions into less demanding iterative functions instead.}
\descitem{Loop Peeling/Splitting}{Remove unchanging variables within for or while loops outside of the loop and process separately (before or after the main loop body).}
\descitem{Loop Unrolling}{Copy and paste the body of a loop in repeated succession if the loop has a small body or few iterations.}
\descitem{Inline Code}{Small functions that occur repeatedly incur a cost of switching to them whenever they are executed. It is better to simply copy-and-paste them as entire code blocks at calling points so that they are part of the current instruction.}
\descitem{Bunch Related Data}{Keep related code blocks and variables close to each other in memory.}

\end{description}


\subsection{Linux Filesystem}\label{ref:app:linuxfs}

\gls{comp:Linux} \gls{comp:OS}'s have filesystem structure that is well-conserved across different versions (or "flavours") of Linux.

The filesystem tree structure is as follows, stemming off the main branching point '/':

\begin{description}
	\descitem{/boot}{Bootloader specific files are stored here and are used to load the initial RAM filesystem which in turn loads the full OS.}
	\descitem{/dev}{Provides special accessors to real and virtual block devices such as terminals, hardisks, input/output buffers, random number streams, etc.}
	\descitem{/etc}{Stores system-wide variables that are preserved across reboots. Noteable entries are \textit{fstab} which stores (and automatically mounts) the mount points of the hard drives used by the OS,  \textit{mdadm} which stores the configuration of a RAID setup, and \textit{resolv.conf} that is used as a nameserver to resolve internet addresses.}
	\descitem{/home}{Location of all user data (separated into respective user-specific folders with user-specific access permissions).}
	\descitem{/mnt}{Generally empty, but can be used as a mount point for anything.}
	\descitem{/opt}{System-wide scripts and binaries that are not installed through the standard system package manager. Convention states that extragenous software should go here.}
	\descitem{/proc}{File descriptors of active (or previously active) processes, with accessible properties such as status and system resource usage.}
	\descitem{/root}{Location of the root user's home directory. Access is frowned upon.}
	\descitem{/sys}{Where platform-specific device settings are retrieved and set.}
	\descitem{/var}{System runtime variables populated by normal OS operation. Reset every boot.}
	\descitem{/tmp}{Same as /var but with user access.}
	\descitem{/usr}{Where all the system libraries, binaries, shared data resources, and include headers are stored. Most \gls{comp:PATH} locations point here.}

\end{description}


Linux also has it's own filesystem types that have limited compatibility with the default Windows filesystems (VFAT and NTFS). 

A few of the more comonly used filesystems are: ext\{2,3,4\}, ReiserFS, BtrFs, XFS, and JFS.  

Each implement partitions and file storage in different ways that lend relative performance boosts in different task-specific ways. 

\subsubsection{Inodes}

Most file systems store files using inodes which are unique descriptors for accessing a file. The reason why filenames are not used as the descriptors themselves is due to the dynamic and changing nature of filenames, wherein a file may be renamed but the file itself remains unchanged. 

It is the inode that assigns the file the new filename without changing the file's location within memory.

Inodes are also useful when linking files via hard and soft symbolic links, where a hard link would point to the actual inode  which would remain valid even if the original file was renamed. A softlink would point only to the original file (which in turn would point to the inode), and would be subject to any changes made to the original file.


\subsubsection{POSIX Permissions}

Most Linux and Unix systems are said to be \gls{comp:POSIX}-compliant if they adhere to the principles set by the standard \cite{walli1995posix}.

One of the most  prominent features of the standard is the set of permissions attributed to each file, where file access is restricted to certain users (or certain groups of users) who can perform certain functions upon it.

File functions are independently limited to: Reading, Writing, and Executing. A file can be read and written to, or written and executable, or just executable, or any variation of three options.

Further, these operations can be limited to a triad of users: the owner, the group, and other users.


\subsection{Semaphores}\label{ref:app:semaphores}

A semaphore is tool that aids in the synchronization in multiple parallel processes/threads such that they can operate concurrently with one another with clashing when accessing the same shared variables.

First invented by Edgar Dijkstra \cite{dijkstra1968cooperating}, they are defined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{A semaphore can be set to any value upon initialization, but can only be incremented/decremented thereafter.}
\item{Each thread that decrements the semaphore must block itself from performing further processing and wait if the semaphore becomes negative. It can only resume processing when another thread increments the semaphore.}
\item{Each thread that increments the semaphore unblocks another waiting thread.}
\end{enumerate}

That is; the value of the semaphore (unknown to all threads) represents the number of active threads when positive, and the number of waiting threads when negative \cite{downey_little_2005}.

Semaphores serve as a means for threads to signal each other when to stop and go, as well being \gls{comp:mutex} variables such that no two threads access the same resource at the same time.






\section{Poisson Distribution}\label{ref:app:poisson}

A discrete probability distribution that describes events that are expected to occur within fixed time intervals, known to recur at an average rate that is independent of the last time interval.

The probability of such events are given by the equation:

\begin{equation}
P(k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-k}}{k!}
\end{equation}

\begin{spacing}{1}
where:
\begin{description}
\descitem{$k = $}{number of expected events in the time interval}
\descitem{$\lambda =$}{the average frequency of said events in the time interval}
\end{description}
\end{spacing}
